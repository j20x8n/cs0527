Course   Information
Course Title: STATISTICAL   DATA   MINING
Course Number and Section: MATH 4720 W03
Course   Description 
An introductory course to statistical data mining.   It covers   some   fundamental   concepts;   popular   techniques; and algorithms in statistical data mining.   Topics   include:   supervised   learning; unsupervised learning; probabilistic reasoning; regression;   and   nearest-neighbors;   classification;   model selection; component analysis; random forest; support vector machine;   and   clustering.
Prerequisite(s):   MATH 3710 or Approved   Petition   Required
Course   Level Student   Learning Outcomes 
Upon successful completion of this course, the student will be able   to:
. Restate basic concepts and terminologies in statistical   learning. 
.       Describe how and when learning works on   practical   problems. 
.       Implement some specific algorithms and methods   in   statistical   learning.
.      Apply some techniques in learning to   real world data.
.       Critically evaluate the results in the form. of written   reports   and   present them to   classmates   and others. 
Instructional Technique(s) This course mainly is taught by   lectures.   For the technical   and   implementing   parts,   I will   ask   students   to use programming to run some simulation   or   real   data   analysis.   During the   lecuturing   process, the students are welcome to give me any feedback or suggestions.
